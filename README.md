## Experimental Version of Spatial Metabolomics Engine
This is an experimental fork of the main [sm-engine](https://github.com/METASPACE2020/sm-engine). This version adds additional features to each match and stores the metrics associated to decoy hits to the database. This version is necessary to run the rescoring pipeline found at [rescore-metabolites](https://github.com/anasilviacs/rescore-metabolites).

Installation and usage instructions can be found in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/anasilviacs/sm-engine/wiki).
